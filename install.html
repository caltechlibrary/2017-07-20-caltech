  <strong>Requirements:</strong>
Data Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to bring in and use their own laptops to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow once you leave the workshop.  (We will provide instructions on setting up the required software several days in advance)
<em> There are no pre-requisites, and we will assume no prior knowledge about the tools.</em> 
</p>

  for questions and information not covered here.
</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<p> To participate in a Data Carpentry workshop, you will need working copies of the software described below. Please 
make sure to install everything and try opening it to make sure it works <em>before</em> the start of your workshop. If 
you run into any problems, please feel free to email the instructor or arrive early to your workshop on the first day.

Participants should bring and use their own laptops to insure the proper setup of 
tools for an efficient workflow once you leave the workshop.
</p>

<p>
  We maintain a list of common issues that occur during installation as a reference for instructors
  that may be useful on the
  <a href = "https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page</a>.

<h3>A spreadsheet program</h3>

<p> For this workshop you will need a spreadsheet program. Many people already have Microsoft Excel installed, and if you do, you're set! 
If you need a spreadsheet program, there are a few other options, like OpenOffice and LibreOffice. Install instructions for LibreOffice, which is free and open source, are here.

  <h3>OpenRefine</h3>

  <p>
    OpenRefine (previously Google Refine) is a tool for data cleaning that runs through a web browser, and any browser - Safari, Firefox, Chrome, 
      Explorer - should work fine. You will need to download OpenRefine and install it, and when you open it, it will run through the browser, but 
      you don't need an internet connection, and the data will all be stored on your computer.

  <h3>Git</h3>
  <p>
    Git is a version control system that lets you track who made changes
    to what when and has options for easily updating a shared or public
    version of your code
    on <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>. You will need a
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/supported-browsers/">supported</a>
    web browser (current versions of Chrome, Firefox or Safari,
    or Internet Explorer version 9 or above).
  </p>
  <p>
    You will need an account at <a href="https://github.com/">github.com</a>
    for parts of the Git lesson. Basic GitHub accounts are free. We encourage
    you to create a GitHub account if you don't have one already.
    Please consider what personal information you'd like to reveal. For
    example, you may want to review these
    <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/">instructions
    for keeping your email address private</a> provided at GitHub.

      To use RStudio, you need to install both R and RStudio.
